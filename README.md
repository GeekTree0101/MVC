# Geektree0101's MVC architecture

In recent years, more and more criticism of the Model-View-Controller pattern (MVC) surfaced and MVC was often blamed for causing too much code in one place and too closely coupled code (“Massive View Controller”). Lots of different patterns were proposed to solve the “MVC-Problem” from MVVM over MVP to VIPER and more. In this talk, we will see that most criticisms of MVC do not really understand what MVC does and does not prescribe. But more importantly, they miss the point: The architecture pattern is not the problem, how we use it is. We will see that other architectures are prone to the same problems as MVC and we will see how to address them in both MVC and other architectures.
